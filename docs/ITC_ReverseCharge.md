## 3. ITC Calculation Example

| Item   | Price/Unit | Qty | GST % | GST Amt | Total With GST |
|--------|------------|-----|-------|---------|----------------|
| Laptop | ‚Çπ50,000    | 1   | 18%   | ‚Çπ9,000  | ‚Çπ59,000        |

- **Claimable ITC:** ‚Çπ9,000
- When filing GST return, deduct ‚Çπ9,000 from output GST liability.
- You only bear the base cost of ‚Çπ50,000 in your books.

## 4. Reverse Charge Mechanism (RCM)

**What is RCM?** Under GST, Reverse Charge means the **recipient** pays GST instead of the supplier. Applies to notified goods/services or unregistered vendors.

- **When does it apply?** E.g., legal services, import of goods/services, or from unregistered suppliers.
- **Accounting Impact:**
    - GST paid by buyer directly to government
    - ITC claimable only after payment
    - Special reporting & compliance
- **Workflow Impact:**
    - System should flag such invoices as RCM
    - Payment & ITC claim tracked separately
    - Additional validations for RCM

### RCM Example
- You hire a **Goods Transport Agency (GTA)**
- Invoice value = ‚Çπ10,000
- GST @ 5% under RCM = ‚Çπ500

| Step            | Who Pays? | GST Amt | Claim ITC? |
|-----------------|-----------|---------|------------|
| GST under RCM   | You       | ‚Çπ500    | ‚úÖ Yes      |
| Input Tax Credit| You       | ‚Çπ500    | ‚úÖ Claimed  |

- You pay ‚Çπ500 to govt as GST under RCM
- You can **claim ‚Çπ500 as ITC** to offset future tax

## 5. Edge Cases: ITC Reversal Scenarios

You **must reverse ITC** in certain cases (i.e., give it back partially or fully):

| Reason                                 | GST Action             | ITC Allowed? |
|----------------------------------------|------------------------|--------------|
| Non-payment to vendor in 180 days      | Reverse ITC + interest | ‚ùå           |
| Goods/services partly for personal use | Proportionate reversal | üîÅ Partial   |
| Credit note issued by supplier         | Reduce ITC             | üîÅ Adjusted  |
| Switch to Composition Scheme           | Reverse full ITC       | ‚ùå           |
| Exempt outward supply increases        | Reverse proportionally | üîÅ Partial   |

‚ö†Ô∏è If payment to vendor not made within 180 days, ITC must be reversed with interest (Rule 37).

---

## 6. Partial Credit (Apportionment)

When goods/services are used for **both business and non-business** or **taxable and exempt** supplies, ITC is claimed **partially**.

**Formula (Rule 42 & 43):**
Eligible ITC = Total ITC √ó (Taxable Turnover √∑ Total Turnover)

Example:
- Total ITC = ‚Çπ10,000
- Taxable Turnover = ‚Çπ80,000
- Total Turnover = ‚Çπ100,000
- ‚û°Ô∏è Eligible ITC = ‚Çπ10,000 √ó 80% = ‚Çπ8,000

üí° *UI Tooltip: Only ‚Çπ8,000 ITC allowed as proportionate credit based on taxable supply ratio (Rule 42).*

---

## 7. Inter-State Purchases (IGST)

When you buy from a different state, IGST is charged. IGST is **fully claimable** as ITC.

Example:
- Buy machinery from Gujarat, invoice shows IGST ‚Çπ18,000
- You‚Äôre in Karnataka, GSTIN: 29XXXXX...
- ‚úÖ You can claim ‚Çπ18,000 as ITC in GSTR-3B under ITC on Import of Goods/Services (IGST)

üí° *UI Tooltip: Inter-state purchases attract IGST. Entire IGST is claimable under Input Tax Credit (IGST).*
