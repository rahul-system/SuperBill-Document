- **Restrictions:**
    - Cannot collect GST from customers
    - Cannot claim Input Tax Credit (ITC)

## 2. Impact on Sale Transactions
- **No GST on Invoice:** Cannot show or collect GST from customers
- **Invoice Format:** Must state:
  `Composition taxable person, not eligible to collect tax on supplies`
- **No Tax Breakdown:** Invoice only shows total value, not GST
- **E-way Bill:**
    - Required only for taxable goods
    - Will mention: **"Bill of Supply"** (not "Tax Invoice")
    - GST amount is not shown on the document

## 3. Impact on Purchase Transactions

- **Expense Booking:** GST paid on purchases is added to cost (not claimable)
- **RCM:**
    - Must pay GST under Reverse Charge if applicable
    - Cannot claim ITC on RCM paid

## 4. UI/Workflow Hints

- **Purchase Entry:**
    - Disable ITC eligibility fields
    - Show warning: *No ITC claim allowed under Composition Scheme*
